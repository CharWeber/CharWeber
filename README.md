## Hello! Welcome!

My name is Charlie Weber And I'm currently a student at Epicodus Coding school. My studies include C#/.net as well as JS, HTML, CSS, and many other technologies

Previously I worked as a lighting designer / tour supervisor traveling the world pointing lights at things. I've recently started my Web Development journey and am enjoying it immensely. I love learning new technologies and trying to make them all work together to create something entirely unique.
I believe in the power of collaboration and diversity in all aspects of life. I've worked extensively in collaborative environments and spend most my hours coding pair programming. In a world of Ideas Diversity is the only way to stay ahead.
